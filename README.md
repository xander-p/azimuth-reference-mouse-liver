# A ready-to-use Azimuth mouse liver cell reference

Constructed from the mouse liver single-cell RNA-seq data from [Liver Cell Atlas](https://www.livercellatlas.org/index.php), maintained by the labs of Charlotte Scott and Martin Guilliams from the VIB-UGent Centre for Inflammation Research, Belgium. Specifically, the dataset "Mouse StSt - All liver cells" was used to construct the reference, originating from the publication [Guilliams M, Bonnardel J, Haest B, et al. Spatial proteogenomics reveals distinct and evolutionarily conserved hepatic macrophage niches. Cell. 2022;185(2):379-396.e38.](doi:10.1016/j.cell.2021.12.018).  

A separate script, as well as the conda environment used to produce this reference, are available in the respective folder.
